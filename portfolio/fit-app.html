                            Fit App enables users to monitor and track their weight and lifting numbers over time. I
                            enjoyed developing this application since it encourages a healthy lifestyle and incorporates
                            data visualization. This application was developed using the Laravel framework.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each user can track their own weight each day, along with the date. The same goes for their
                            three main lifts: squat, deadlift, and bench press. Statistics are generated from their main
                            lifts, such as their 1 Rep Maximum and where they stand in terms of their strength relative to
                            other people their size.

                            I initially wanted to make an application that would help me track my own weightlifting data,
                            but as time went on, I knew I should extend it to help me track my weight as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This was the first time I had worked with the D3.js graphing library, but I learned a lot.
                            The graphs used in this application were quite simple, but making them animated was a good
                            learning process for me. Data values are plotted on the chart, and tooltips are displayed
                            when hovering over the points.
                        </p>

                            I ended up making an application that would chart a user's strength in regards to their own
                            lifts and weight. Also, it was my first time developing an application that uses Material Design.
                            I'd like to re-visit this project and add more complicated and stylized charts, as well as
                            re-design the UI since there was a lack of knowledge on my part with Material Design practices.
